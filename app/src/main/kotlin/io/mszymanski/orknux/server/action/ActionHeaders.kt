 * because the form shows it back to them; [variableId] is for everything that
 * should not be stored that way, and it names the variable rather than copying
 * what the variable holds. That is the whole point of the reference: a bearer
 * token stays in the variables screen, encrypted at rest and revealed only as an
 * audited act, and the action holds a number pointing at it.

/**
 * What an HTTP request action's headers are written as, and what they come to.
 *
 * The headers live where they always have - one text column on the action,
 * holding JSON - and the grammar of that JSON is what widened. Two shapes are
 * readable and only one is ever written:
 *
 *  - **An object** is what every action saved before references existed holds:
 *    `{"Authorization": "Bearer …"}`, one literal per key. It is read as rows in
 *    the order the keys were written and is never written back in that shape, so
 *    an action people already have goes on sending exactly what it sent until
 *    somebody saves the form, and sends exactly the same thing afterwards.
 *
 *  - **An array** is the shape this writes: `[{"name": …, "value": …}, {"name":
 *    …, "variableId": "12"}]`. Ordered, so two headers may share a name the way
 *    HTTP allows, and each row says which of the two sources it is.
 *
 * Anything else - a truncated blob, a smart quote, a fragment somebody pasted -
 * is left in the column exactly as it stands and read as nothing. That is what
 * the runner already did with unreadable JSON, so an action that has been
 * quietly sending no headers goes on quietly sending no headers rather than
 * starting to fail; the form is what says so, where somebody can fix it.
 *
 * Nothing here logs a resolved value. A header is as likely to be an
 * authorization as an accept, and the two are indistinguishable by the time they
 * are here.
