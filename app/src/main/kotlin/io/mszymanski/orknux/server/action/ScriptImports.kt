/**
 * Works out what a script imports, and in what order it has to be evaluated.
 *
 * The sandbox resolves nothing. It is handed modules that are already found,
 * already flattened and already sorted, and it evaluates them in the order it was
 * given — so this class is the whole of the resolution, and the whole of what could
 * go wrong with it.
 *
 * Two things are asked of it. A save asks it to check an import list before it is
 * stored: does everything exist, may this workspace reach it, and would the graph
 * still be a graph afterwards. A run asks it to assemble what the sandbox needs.
 * Both walk the same edges, which is why they are the same class — a check that
 * walked different edges from the run would be a check that passes what then fails.
 *
 * An import is followed by id and offered under the importer's own name. That is
 * the whole reason a rename costs nothing: the row that points at a function does
 * not hold its name, and the code that calls it does not hold its id.
