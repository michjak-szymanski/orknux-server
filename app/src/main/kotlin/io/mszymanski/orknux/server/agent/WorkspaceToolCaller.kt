 * cannot reach. This is the opposite case: a tool *is* the workspace's code, and
 * the sandbox is exactly where it belongs. Nothing here widens it — the same
 * [ScriptRunner] runs it, with the same limits, and everything crossing the
 * boundary is JSON text.
 *
 * What an agent may call is what it was granted. That matters more here than for
 * the reading tools: a skill is a page an agent reads, and a tool does something.
