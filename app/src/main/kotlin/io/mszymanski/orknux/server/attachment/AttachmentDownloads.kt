/**
 * Handing an attachment's bytes back to a browser.
 *
 * One class for every kind of attachment there is - a chat's and an issue's -
 * because what is settled here is not presentation. It is which types may be
 * shown rather than downloaded, and the headers that stop a file which is not
 * what it claims to be from running as a page; a second copy of that would
 * drift, and the copy that drifted is the one nobody would be watching.
 *
 * The caller has already decided that whoever is asking may see the workspace
 * the file belongs to. This only writes the answer.

     * already carries `sandbox` - a document served under it is in an opaque
     * origin with no script, no forms and no access to anything of ours, and
     * that is true whatever the bytes turn out to be. An HTML report an agent
     * wrote is then a page somebody can open and read, rather than a file they
     * download and go looking for.

     * SVG stays off the list. It is markup that a browser will treat as an
     * image in contexts this header does not reach - an `<img src>` on our own
     * page, most of all - and "it is an image" is exactly the reasoning that
     * makes that a problem.
