/**
 * Naming a chat from what was said in it.
 *
 * "New chat" is the right name for an empty one and a useless name for a list of
 * them, so the first exchange earns a real one. The work is done by the
 * workspace's companion model rather than the model being talked to: it is not
 * part of the conversation, and it should be able to be something cheap.
 *
 * A workspace with no companion model simply keeps the name it gave. Nothing
 * about this is important enough to fail a chat over — a title that did not
 * arrive is a title, and the person can rename it.
