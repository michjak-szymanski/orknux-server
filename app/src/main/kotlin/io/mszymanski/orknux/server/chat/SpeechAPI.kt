 * rather than GraphQL for the reason that one is: what comes back is audio, and
 * a JSON field would mean base64 for bytes the browser is about to play.
 *
 * The text is sent rather than named by message id, which is deliberate. An
 * answer that has just finished streaming is on screen before it has an id the
 * interface knows, and a speaker that worked on yesterday's messages but not on
 * the one somebody just read would be the wrong way round.
