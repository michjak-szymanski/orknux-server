/**
 * What a dependency question is asked about, and what an answer may name.
 *
 * One vocabulary for both ends of the arrow. A function is a subject — "what
 * uses this?" — and it is also an answer, because a function imports another
 * one; so a single enum says both, and a kind that is only ever one end says so
 * in its comment rather than in a second enum.
 *
 * **Not [ComponentKind][io.mszymanski.orknux.server.transfer.ComponentKind].**
 * That one is the catalogue of what an envelope can carry, and it is short for a
 * reason: a variable, a library and a connection all hold something that cannot
 * travel. This one is the catalogue of what can point at what, and those three
 * are exactly the interesting cases — a variable is the credential of a
 * connection, a library is imported by a tool in a workspace the reader may not
 * be able to open. Widening the transfer enum to fit them would offer
 * `exportComponent(kind: VARIABLE)`, which is a promise the exporter cannot
 * keep.

/**
 * One thing that depends on a component, said once and read two ways.
 *
 * This is the whole of #258 and #268 in one class. The delete guards each grew
 * their own answer to "what uses this", each assembled a sentence out of it, and
 * a sentence is where a name stops being something anybody can follow: being
 * told *"That library is imported by slugify in Backend"* leaves the reader to go
 * and find `slugify` by hand. So the answer is a row with an id on it, and the
 * sentence is one of the two things that row can become.
 *
 * [phrase] is that sentence's clause, and it is carried on the entry rather than
 * derived from [kind] because the wording is the *subject's* and not the
 * dependant's. A function that calls another function is named bare, because the
 * reader is looking at a list of functions; the same function importing a library
 * is "slugify in Backend", because the reader is an administrator looking across
 * workspaces; a trigger is "the webhook Nightly", because a webhook is not in any
 * list a bare name would send somebody to. Those wordings were each argued for
 * where they were written and none of them is wrong — what was wrong was
 * computing the set twice.
 *
 * @param id always present, because a row without one is a row nothing can link
 *   to, and a link is the point.
 * @param workspaceId null for a function the organisation owns, which belongs to
 *   no workspace.
 * @param published whether this names the frozen copy rather than the drawn one.
 *   Only a [DependencyKind.WORKFLOW] ever sets it, and it changes what the reader
 *   has to do about it: a draft is redrawn, a publication is republished.
