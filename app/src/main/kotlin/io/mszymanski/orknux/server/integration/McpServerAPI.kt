     * matches nothing — and `McpToolCaller` drops a grant matching no server,
     * so the capability would go without a word while the agent's screen went
     * on listing it.
     *
     * That is the same defect [removeMcpServer] was given a guard for, reached
     * by a different door and arguably the worse of the two. Removing is a
     * deliberate destructive act done by somebody paying attention. Renaming is
     * tidying, and nobody expects tidying to disable anything.
     *
     * Followed rather than refused, and followed rather than reported: the
     * agent asked for *that server* and still means it, so moving the grant is
     * what keeps the intent. Nothing is handed back for the same reason —
     * nothing broke, so there is no warning to print. Which agents were touched
     * is in the audit, a line each, which is where somebody goes to ask what a
     * rename did.
     *
     * Transactional because it is a server and several agents: half a rename is
     * worse than none, since the half left behind is exactly the stale name.
