/**
 * Putting files on an issue, and reading them back.
 *
 * REST rather than GraphQL for the reason the chat's upload is: what crosses
 * here is bytes, and a multipart form is what a browser makes of a file picker.
 *
 * Uploaded against the workspace rather than against the issue, because there
 * is not always an issue yet - a screenshot is picked while the report is still
 * being written, and waiting until "File Issue" is pressed would mean waiting
 * for the upload then. Which issue it belongs to is settled afterwards, by
 * `attachToIssue`, exactly as a chat's files are settled when the message is
 * sent.
 *
 * Whether files may be attached at all is the installation's answer, not this
 * tracker's: the same switch, the same size limit and the same storage as the
 * chat, so an operator who has said no has said no once.
