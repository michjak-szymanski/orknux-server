/**
 * Fetching one package from an npm registry, once, at an administrator's request.
 *
 * **Why this exists at all, given what [ScriptLibrary] says.** That note rules out
 * a library that *is* a name from a registry, and it still does. What is fetched
 * here is a file, and the file is what is stored and what runs; the registry is a
 * way of *getting* it and is never consulted again. Nothing about the sandbox
 * changes — it has no network before this and none after — and an installation
 * with no registry configured goes on being an installation where a library is a
 * file somebody uploads.
 *
 * The three things that have to be true for that to be honest, and where each one
 * is enforced:
 *
 * **A version is pinned, by the person asking.** [resolve] refuses `latest`, a
 * range and a bare name. There is no default, because a default would be a
 * version this server picked on a day nobody was looking, and "what code is
 * running here" would then have as many answers as there were installs.
 *
 * **What was fetched is recorded and checked.** The registry says what the file it
 * is about to serve hashes to; [verify] hashes what arrived and compares. The
 * resolved version, the URL, that hash and the path inside the package are all
 * stored on the row, so the artefact can be shown to be what it claims — and can
 * be fetched again elsewhere and compared.
 *
 * **It goes out the way everything else does.** The client is built from
 * [ProxyRouter.builder], so an installation whose outbound traffic has to cross a
 * proxy reaches the registry through it. A second HTTP client here would be the
 * bug #176 found in Slack in a new place: rules that cover most of the product and
 * silently miss one screen.
 *
 * **On dependencies, this refuses rather than bundles.** See [Fetched] and
 * [LibraryDependsException].
