/**
 * How much of a session may go back in front of a model, in one object.
 *
 * The five numbers that used to be `private const` in [LlmSessionRecorder].
 * They were sized against one installation's models and one installation's
 * tools - the eight thousand characters any single lookup was allowed came from
 * a workspace's open issues measuring under five thousand and every issue in it
 * measuring over forty, which is a fact about `orknux_issues` rather than about
 * anybody else's tools - and nobody could change them without a rebuild.
 *
 * **Where the setting lives, and why.** A budget is a share of a context
 * window, so it is two things owned by two different rows and it is stored as
 * two things:
 *
 * - The **window** belongs to the model, and is already on it: `contextWindow`
 *   on `llm_model`. An installation runs models whose windows differ by an
 *   order of magnitude, so a single number set once for the installation is
 *   generous on one of them and a provider error on the next. Nothing new was
 *   stored for this half; it was already there and merely unused.
 * - The **share** belongs to the agent, and is `agent.memory_share`. What a
 *   budget should be depends on what that agent's tools give back: an agent
 *   reading whole files needs a different allowance from one reading issue
 *   lists, and both may be pointed at the same model.
 * - And where the agent says nothing, the share belongs to the workspace:
 *   `workspace.default_memory_share`. The per-agent setting is the right place
 *   to make an exception and the wrong place to state a policy - an
 *   installation that wants its agents to remember more than the built-in
 *   allowance was saying so once per agent and again on every agent made
 *   afterwards. So the order is **agent, then workspace, then built-in**, and a
 *   workspace that sets nothing leaves every agent exactly where it was.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `ORKNUX_` variable for any of it. An installation-
 * wide number is the one answer that is wrong for every model in the
 * installation, which is the thing this replaces rather than a cheaper spelling
 * of it. The workspace default is not that number wearing a different hat: it
 * is a share rather than a count, so it still means something different against
 * each of the workspace's models, and it is one workspace's decision rather
 * than the whole installation's.
 *
 * **One number, not five.** Somebody setting this is answering "how much
 * conversation should it carry", and four of the five fall out of that answer:
 * see [of]. Only [results] does not, because it is a read-ahead rather than a
 * budget - the reason is on it.
 *
 * **Characters, converted at the surface.** Every count here is characters,
 * which is what the recorder counts and what every model agrees on. Nothing
 * user-facing says "characters": the API speaks tokens and divides by
 * [CHARS_PER_TOKEN] on the way out, because whoever sets this reads a number
 * beside a context window as tokens whatever the label says, and would be out
 * by a factor of four. The conversion is an approximation and is described as
 * one wherever it appears.
