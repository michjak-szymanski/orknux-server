/**
 * What has happened on the issues that concern you, with the option of waiting
 * for it.
 *
 * The tracker exists so that work is discussed where everybody can read it, and
 * that only works if the people in it find out. A person has a page they can
 * look at; an assistant has nothing, so until now somebody had to say "I
 * replied on #6" by hand - which is the message the tracker was supposed to
 * replace.
 *
 * **Waiting is a parameter, not a protocol.** MCP can push, over an event
 * stream a client holds open; this server speaks plain request and answer, and
 * every client that would have to hold that stream open is instead perfectly
 * happy to hold one call open. So the call blocks until something happens or
 * the time runs out. Nothing to reconnect, nothing to resume, and it works
 * through anything that passes HTTP.
 *
 * **The call is held open; a thread is not.** The answer is a promise, kept
 * when the news arrives or when the time is up, and the caller's request is
 * answered from there. That is not tidiness. Tomcat has two hundred threads,
 * five minutes is a wait anybody may ask for, and anybody who can sign in can
 * ask for it - so a wait that cost a thread meant two hundred calls could take
 * the whole server off the air for five minutes, and the tool whose entire
 * purpose is waiting would be the way to do it. Between one wake and the next
 * a waiter holds no thread, no transaction and no database connection: it is a
 * promise on a list and nothing else.
 *
 * **Reading marks it read**, and the mark is kept here rather than handed back
 * as a cursor. An assistant restarted between sessions remembers nothing, and a
 * cursor it forgets means either a week of events repeated or a day of them
 * silently skipped.
