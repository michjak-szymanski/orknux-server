/**
 * The text if it is a drawing, and null if it is not.
 *
 * Several places ask this and they used to ask it differently — one wanted
 * `<svg` or `<?xml`, one wanted only `<svg`, and the zip path did not ask at
 * all, which is how an icon whose file opens with a licence comment ended up
 * stored and then printed as its own source on the screen. So it is one
 * function, here, rather than a rule each door remembers.
 *
 * What is skipped is everything a real SVG file is allowed to open with before
 * its root element: whitespace, an XML declaration, a doctype, and comments.
 * Whatever is left has to be the `<svg` tag itself.
 *
 * This is a sanity check rather than a safety one. What makes somebody else's
 * markup safe to draw is that it is put in an `<img>` as a data URI, where a
 * browser renders it as a picture and runs nothing in it — the screen's job,
 * not this one's.

/**
 * The faces on the catalog screen, fetched here rather than by the browser.
 *
 * A listing's icon arrives as a URL on the marketplace, and until this landed
 * the screen simply put that URL in an `<img>` — so the one outbound call the
 * catalog made that did not go through [ProxyRouter] was the only one this
 * server was not making at all. On an installation whose egress is a proxy, or
 * one that reaches the marketplace through a rule and nothing else directly,
 * every icon on the page was a broken square: the rules were right, the
 * catalog loaded, and the pictures were fetched by a browser those rules have
 * no say over.
 *
 * So the bytes come across here, on the same client every other outbound call
 * uses, and the listing carries the drawing itself. Which is also what an
 * install already did with the icon it keeps — this is the same move, made a
 * step earlier.
 *
 * ## What it will fetch
 *
 * The marketplace's own host and nowhere else, which [MarketplaceInstallKey.own]
 * is the existing answer to. A catalog is somebody else's JSON: a listing whose
 * icon pointed at `http://169.254.169.254/` would otherwise be this server
 * fetching it and handing the answer to a screen. An icon hosted anywhere else
 * is left as the URL it was, which is what the screen did with every icon
 * before — no worse than yesterday, and not a door.
 *
 * ## Why it is cached
 *
 * The catalog is read afresh on every visit to the screen and an icon is not:
 * it is a small file that changes when a plugin is re-published. Without a
 * cache, opening the screen would fetch a dozen files that were fetched a
 * minute ago, and the wait would be on the catalog rather than on them.
 * Failures are remembered too, briefly — an air-gapped installation should ask
 * once and draw its placeholders, not ask a dozen times per visit forever.
