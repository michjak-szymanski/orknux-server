/**
 * One page of a PDF, drawn as a PNG.
 *
 * ## Why a server does this
 *
 * An agent that writes a document cannot look at it. A PDF is bytes; a model
 * that can see reads pictures, and the two are different things in a request -
 * so an agent handed its own output in base64 knows only that it exists. It
 * says "the report is ready" because that is what it did, not because that is
 * what came out, and a document with its diagram off the page or its table cut
 * in half is reported as finished.
 *
 * This is the other half of [SvgRenderer], and it is there for the same reason:
 * the sandbox cannot do it. Rasterising a PDF means a font stack, a colour
 * model and a path renderer; there is no such thing in pure JavaScript worth
 * having, and GraalJS here has no WebAssembly to borrow one through.
 *
 * ## What it will draw
 *
 * One page at a time, of a document small enough to hold in memory, at a width
 * a screen would show. A PDF is an untrusted document format with an
 * embedded-file model and an encryption model, and PDFBox is a parser like any
 * other - so the bounds are here rather than assumed, and what arrives is
 * always something this installation made a moment ago.
