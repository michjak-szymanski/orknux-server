/**
 * Turns the shapes a plugin exports into objects a workspace can point at.
 *
 * The sibling of [PluginFunctionRegistry], and the same arrangement: the
 * declaration is the plugin's, these rows are the server's record of it, and
 * they are scoped to the plugin rather than to a workspace so every workspace
 * can use them.
 *
 * **Rows in the table a workspace's own objects live in**, deliberately. A
 * property points at an object by id, and everything that follows one of those
 * references — the shape a model is told, the check an answer is held to, the
 * picker a return type is chosen from — follows it without asking whose row it
 * is. A table of its own would mean teaching every one of those about a second
 * kind, and every one of them would eventually be taught late.
 *
 * **Two passes, because a shape may point at another.** The plugin names its
 * references — `of: 'User'` — and a reference on a row is an id, so nothing can
 * be wired until every row exists. The first pass makes or updates the rows
 * without their references; the second fills them in. A plugin whose objects
 * point at each other in a circle is fine: the rows exist by then.
 *
 * Reconciled rather than appended, again like the functions: what the plugin
 * declares now is what exists afterwards. One it no longer declares goes —
 * unless something still points at it, which is the plugin taking away
 * something in use, and worth refusing rather than breaking.
