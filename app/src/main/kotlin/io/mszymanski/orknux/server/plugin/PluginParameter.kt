/**
 * What one workspace set one of a plugin's parameters to.
 *
 * A plugin is loaded once for the whole installation, but what it should be
 * pointed at is not the same everywhere: two workspaces using the same issue
 * tracker plugin talk to two projects with two tokens. So the declaration belongs
 * to the plugin and the answer belongs to the workspace, and this row is the
 * answer.
 *
 * Exactly one of [literalValue], [secretValue] and [variableId] is set.
 *
 * A literal is a value somebody typed and is stored as typed, in the clear,
 * because it is shown back to them. A secret somebody typed goes to
 * [secretValue] instead, which is encrypted and never shown back - the screen
 * is told that it is set and nothing more. And [variableId] points at one of
 * the workspace's variables, which is still the better answer wherever one
 * credential serves more than one thing: it is shared, owned, has a history,
 * and rotating it is one edit rather than four.
 *
 * A row for a parameter the plugin no longer declares is possible - a plugin can be
 * loaded again with a different declaration - and it is simply not read. Deleting
 * it on reload would throw away a value that a corrected plugin would want back an
 * hour later.
