/**
 * A component written down, and read back onto itself.
 *
 * Both directions are spelled out by hand for the reasons `WorkflowSnapshot`
 * gives — the mapper this application shares has no Kotlin module, so reading
 * into a data class fails, and a shape kept in a database outlives the class it
 * came from. A field absent from an older snapshot reads as the default it
 * always had, which is what lets last month's revision restore after a
 * component gains a property.
 *
 * Two things it is not, and both were tried elsewhere first.
 *
 * It is not `ComponentExporter`'s envelope. That format represents what a
 * component points at *by name*, which is right for carrying work between
 * installations and wrong here: rename the object a parameter is typed against
 * and last week's revision would restore pointing at something else, silently.
 * Everything here is an id, and an id that no longer resolves is a dangling
 * reference the screen reports — the same failure the live row would have.
 *
 * And it is not reflection over the entity. A tool's `params` were missing from
 * the exporter for exactly as long as nobody looked; a format written out field
 * by field is one where an addition has to be typed, and therefore noticed.
