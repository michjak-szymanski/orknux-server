/**
 * Who an installation with [AuthMethod.NONE] acts as, and why it is somebody.
 *
 * **Why there has to be an identity at all.** Nothing downstream of the front door
 * was written for a caller who is nobody. An audit entry records
 * `authentication.name`, an issue keeps its reporter as a name, a chat session has
 * an owner, `WorkspaceAccess` reads roles off the authentication, and the
 * preferences page reads a row out of `app_user`. Turning authentication off by
 * removing the caller would mean touching every one of those, and each of them
 * would then have a second, untested path through it — the one where there is no
 * user — which is exactly the kind of path a security-relevant switch must not
 * create. So the switch does not remove the caller. It fixes it.
 *
 * **What that identity is.** An ordinary INTERNAL row in `app_user`, named
 * [OPEN_ACCESS_USERNAME], created here on the first start under this method and
 * left alone on every start after. It holds the built-in administrator role, and
 * it holds *no password hash*, which is the part worth being precise about:
 * [io.mszymanski.orknux.server.user.InternalAuthentication] refuses an account
 * without one, so this row cannot be signed in as. It is not a back door left
 * behind when authentication is turned back on — under LDAP, OIDC or INTERNAL this
 * class does nothing, no filter is installed, and the row is an inert name on the
 * Users screen.
 *
 * **Why it administers, said plainly.** Because the alternative is dishonest
 * rather than safer. This mode exists for trying the product out and for an
 * installation already behind somebody else's gate; both need the Admin section,
 * since there is nobody to grant it later. A non-administrator open identity would
 * be an installation nobody could ever configure, and the operator's first move
 * would be to widen it by hand. There is no middle position that means anything:
 * once nobody has to prove who they are, whoever can reach the port has whatever
 * this identity has. So it has everything, and every surface says so out loud —
 * see [AUTHENTICATION_OFF], which is the one sentence all of them use.
 *
 * **What that costs, deliberately accepted.** Every audit entry on such an
 * installation reads `everyone`, and it is telling the truth: any of them could
 * have done it, and the installation was never told which. An audit log that
 * invented a name would be worse than one that admits it does not know.
 * `@Convert`-encrypted credentials are readable, workspaces are all visible, and
 * the admin screens are open — to anybody who can reach the port. That is what
 * turning authentication off means, and it is why this is not the default and why
 * it cannot be arrived at by a typo.
