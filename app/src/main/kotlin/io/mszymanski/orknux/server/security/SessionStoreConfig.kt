/**
 * Sessions in the database, so signing in outlives the process.
 *
 * Enabled here rather than left to auto-configuration, which is not a preference:
 * Spring Boot 4 splits auto-configuration into a module per technology —
 * `spring-boot-jdbc`, `spring-boot-security`, `spring-boot-ldap` and so on — and
 * there is no session module on this classpath. Adding `spring-session-jdbc` alone
 * put the repository *class* within reach and wired nothing: no repository bean, no
 * filter, and every session still a Tomcat object in this JVM's heap. It looked
 * exactly like it was working — the tables existed, nothing errored, and the table
 * stayed empty while somebody was signed in.
 *
 * The annotation creates the repository and the filter itself, so this does not
 * depend on which auto-configuration modules happen to be present.
 *
 * The schema is not created here. Flyway owns it, in V71, copied from Spring
 * Session's own DDL — two things creating tables is two things that can disagree.

 * The cleanup schedule is written here rather than taken from a property: Spring
 * Session validates this attribute as a cron expression before any placeholder in it

 * says nothing about the actual cause. Half past every hour, and the hour, is not
 * something an installation needs to tune.

     * How a session read or write is wrapped in a transaction.
     *
     * Spring Session would make this itself, and would make it REQUIRES_NEW: a
     * session is stored whatever becomes of the work that stored it, which is
     * what you want from a session store and costs a second connection while the
     * caller's transaction waits.
     *
     * That is right on Postgres and is a deadlock on SQLite, where there is one
     * write lock for the whole database. The caller holds it, the session's own
     * transaction waits for it on another connection, and the caller cannot
     * reach its commit until the wait ends. Nothing resolves that; it fails
     * after the busy timeout, on whichever request happened to end a session or
     * reset a password.
     *
     * So on SQLite the session joins the caller instead - one connection, no
     * wait. The independence is what is given up: a request that rolls back now
     * takes what it wrote about its own session with it. On a database that
     * takes one writer that is the lesser of the two, and on Postgres nothing
     * changes.
     *
     * The bean name is not decoration. Spring Session looks this up by the
     * qualifier `springSessionTransactionOperations` and builds its own when
     * nothing answers to it.
