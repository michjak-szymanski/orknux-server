/**
 * Slowing down a caller who keeps getting it wrong.
 *
 * `POST /api/session` is the one door anybody may knock on, and until this it
 * counted nothing. A twelve character minimum and an unknown username that
 * returns before bcrypt runs meant it was not a free way to burn the processor,
 * but a username somebody knows exists - and in an internal tracker most of them
 * are - could be tried at whatever rate the network allowed, and under LDAP
 * every one of those tries landed on the directory as well.
 *
 * **Both a username and an address**, because either alone is half a rule. Per
 * username only, and one machine works through a list of names and is never
 * slowed at all. Per address only, and a botnet spreads a single username across
 * a thousand of them.
 *
 * **Backoff rather than lockout.** A wait doubles and then stops, and a record
 * that has been quiet is forgotten, so there is no state anybody can put you in
 * that you cannot get out of by waiting. That is not softness: an account that
 * locks is an account a stranger can close by guessing at it badly on purpose.
 *
 * **A refused attempt is not counted.** It never reached a password check, so
 * counting it would let somebody hold a colleague's username at the ceiling
 * indefinitely simply by continuing to knock - which is the lockout this is
 * built to avoid, arrived at by a longer road.
 *
 * **In this process, in memory.** No datastore and no dependency: the state is
 * a few counters, it is worth nothing after a restart, and an installation
 * running two instances gets two counters that are each strict enough. Buying a
 * shared one would cost an operator a service to run for a benefit they cannot
 * see.
 *
 * **Primary, because there is more than one of these.** The class is instantiated
 * a second time for the forgotten-password form, which needs the same rules and
 * must not share the counters - otherwise anybody able to reach that form could
 * put a colleague's username into a pause here. This one is sign-in's, and
 * anything that wants the other asks for it by name.
