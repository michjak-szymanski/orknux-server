/**
 * A picture a task drew.
 *
 * The row is the record and the bytes are elsewhere, exactly as a chat's
 * attachment and an issue's are: what is stored is where they went, so a second
 * kind of storage would be a change in one class rather than a migration of
 * everything anybody has ever produced.
 *
 * What it holds that the other two do not is [prompt], and that is why it is a
 * table of its own. Nothing uploads a file to a task; every row here is
 * something an agent drew from a description, and the description is what makes
 * a picture identifiable without opening it - the alt text under the outcome,
 * and the name of the file if it is saved.
