/**
 * What a task may spend before it is stopped and told so.
 *
 * An agent running until it decides it is done is an unbounded bill, and the
 * reasoning here is the reasoning behind the retry policy's budget: a count of
 * goes bounds how often the model is asked, and it says nothing at all about
 * what happens between two of them. A shell command that sits there for a
 * minute, an MCP server that takes its time, a model that thinks for two -
 * five turns of that is not five model calls' worth of time, and no number of
 * turns can express it. So there are two ceilings and they bound different
 * things.
 *
 * Both are copied onto the task when it is created rather than read while it
 * runs, so raising a default does not extend a task already going and lowering
 * one does not kill it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no ceiling on tokens here. A model already carries its
 * own usage cap with a reset interval, which is the installation's real answer
 * to "what may this cost"; a second half-counter on the task would be a number
 * that disagrees with the one on the bill.
