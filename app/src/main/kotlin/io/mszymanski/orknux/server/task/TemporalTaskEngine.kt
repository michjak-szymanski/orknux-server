/**

 * execution: it runs for an hour, it may then wait a week for somebody to
 * approve something, and the whole of it must survive a deployment. All three
 * are what Temporal already does for a workflow run here.
 *
 * The workflow is started and not awaited, for the same reason a run is: a task
 * outlives the request that asked for it, and the person who asked is looking at
