/**
 * The installation's templates: stored envelopes, described and handed back.
 *
 * Everything that decides what a template *is* happens in two places that are
 * not here — [ComponentExporter] writes the envelope and [ComponentImporter]
 * reads it — and this holds the rows in between. What it does add is the rule
 * that a template is validated when it is published rather than when somebody
 * tries to use it: an envelope that cannot be read is refused at the New
 * Template screen, which is the moment there is somebody present who can fix it.
 *
 * The one case that survives that is a file which was readable when it was
 * published and is not now, which happens when an installation is rolled back
 * past the format version its templates were written under. That is why
 * [view] catches rather than throws: the row is still shown, with its name and
 * the refusal in words, instead of the page failing to load because one of forty
 * templates is from the future.
