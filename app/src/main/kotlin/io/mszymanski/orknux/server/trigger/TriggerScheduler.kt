/**
 * Fires the scheduled triggers.
 *
 * db-scheduler owns the clock: the tick below is a recurring task in the
 * database, so it runs on one instance however many are up, and a restart picks
 * it up where it was rather than firing everything again.
 *
 * What the tick does is compare each enabled definition's cron with when it last
 * fired. That is what makes a trigger's schedule editable while the process
 * runs — nothing is registered per trigger, so nothing has to be unregistered.
 *
 * It used to fire the single next occurrence, once a minute, which made a
 * minute the smallest schedule this could keep. Seconds parsed and were
 * accepted the whole time — `sixField` passes six fields straight through — so
 * a cron of every ten seconds saved cleanly and then fired six times less often
 * than it said. Now the tick runs on [TriggerSchedulerProperties.tickInterval] and
 * fires every occurrence that came due in the window, so a schedule finer than
 * the tick arrives in bursts rather than being quietly thinned.
