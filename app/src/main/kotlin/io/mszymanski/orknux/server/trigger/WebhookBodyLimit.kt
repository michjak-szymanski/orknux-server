/**
 * A bound on what an anonymous caller can make this server hold.
 *
 * The webhook endpoint is open to the internet by necessity - a build server
 * cannot sign in - and its body used to be whatever arrived. What arrived became
 * a String, then a Jackson tree, then a copy of that tree, then a serialisation
 * of the copy, then a row in the run's input: five things the size of the
 * request, from a caller who proved nothing, and the caller decided the size.
 *
 * **The bound belongs here rather than in the endpoint.** By the time
 * `WebhookAPI.receive` is called the body is already a String, so a check there
 * would be a check on something already spent. It is not configuration on the
 * container either - Boot caps multipart uploads and nothing else, and a JSON
 * POST is not multipart - and putting it there would bound every endpoint
 * including the ones that legitimately take a large upload. So: a filter, on
 * this path, ahead of everything.
 *
 * **Refused with 413, uniformly.** The endpoint's rule is that a caller must not
 * be able to tell an armed webhook path from an empty one, and this keeps it: it
 * runs before anything is routed, so every path answers a too-large body the
 * same way whether it exists or not. Nothing is written to the trigger's
 * history, because at this point there is no trigger yet - which is the price of
 * refusing early, and the right way round.
 *
 * The declared length is checked first and the stream is counted anyway, since a
 * chunked request declares nothing and an honest length is not something the
 * caller can be trusted for.
