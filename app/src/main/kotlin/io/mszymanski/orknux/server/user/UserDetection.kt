/**
 * Writes down who signs in.
 *
 * The provider knows its people; this installation only meets them one at a
 * time, at the door. Each successful sign-in upserts an EXTERNAL row, which is
 * how the Users page has anything external to list at all — there is no
 * directory query behind it, deliberately: an LDAP tree or an OIDC issuer is
 * not ours to enumerate, and the people who matter here are the ones who have
 * actually been here.
 *
 * **Which doors announce an arrival, and which deliberately do not.** This used
 * to claim Spring published the event for every path, which was never true and
 * was expensive to believe: the listener was correct from the day it was
 * written and recorded nobody, because the one door most installations use said
 * nothing when somebody came through it.
 *
 * - **The directory.** [io.mszymanski.orknux.server.ldap.LdapAuthenticationConfig]
 *   builds its manager itself, so it has to put the publisher on itself. That is
 *   the fix; the comment there says why it was missing.
 * - **OIDC**, both ways in — the browser flow and a bearer token. Spring
 *   Security registers those providers on the manager it assembles for the
 *   filter chain, and that one carries a publisher already.
 * - **A password this installation holds.** No event, and nothing to record: an
 *   internal user is checked against a row in this very table, so they cannot
 *   sign in without already being written down. Announcing them would only mean
 *   looking them up to find nothing had changed.
 * - **An API token.** No event, and that is the intent rather than an omission.
 *   A token is a key its owner left somewhere, not a person arriving; it is
 *   minted for a user who is a row already, and it is presented on every single
 *   request by things that keep no session.
