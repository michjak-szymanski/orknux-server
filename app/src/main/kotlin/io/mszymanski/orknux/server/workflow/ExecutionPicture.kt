/**
 * A picture an image node drew, kept with the run that drew it.
 *
 * The row is the record and the bytes are elsewhere, exactly as a task's picture
 * and a chat's attachment are: what is stored here is where they went, so a
 * different kind of storage would be a change in one class rather than a
 * migration of everything anybody has ever produced. [TaskPicture] is the twin
 * of this, and drew from the same [io.mszymanski.orknux.connector.model.ModelImageClient];
 * what differs is where it belongs - a task's picture hangs off a task, this
 * hangs off one run's one step, which is [nodeKey] beside [executionId].
 *
 * The pictures of one execution are its dedicated place: the run graph reads
 * them back by execution to show a preview under the node that drew each, and
 * the download link is one per row. Issue #333.
