/**
 * What a node was told to pass on, and what that comes to once the run is
 * carrying something.
 *
 * A parameter is either a value, used exactly as written, or a reference to a
 * field the run is carrying. There is no substitution and no syntax: text that
 * looks like a placeholder is text.
 *
 * There are two ways to want the answer, and the difference matters. An action
 * argument is JSON — a string argument has to arrive quoted, or the function
 * receives something that is not a string. A prompt is read by a model, and
 * quoting it would put the quote marks in the sentence. So the caller says which
 * it needs.
