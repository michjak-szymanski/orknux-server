/**
 * A file an agent saved, because it made something worth keeping.
 *
 * The third kind of artifact, and the first that is not a picture drawn from a
 * description. An agent that renders a diagram, formats a report or produces a
 * CSV has, until now, had nowhere to put it: it could say the text back to
 * whoever asked and that was the end of it. This is the place, and the
 * Artifacts page is where it shows up.
 *
 * A table of its own for the reason [io.mszymanski.orknux.server.task.TaskPicture]
 * is one: what it holds that the other two do not is that nobody drew it. There
 * is no prompt and no image model - there is a name the agent chose and bytes
 * it handed over - so folding it into either would mean a `prompt` column
 * holding something that is not one.
 *
 * The bytes are in the installation's own store, as both picture tables' are.
 * That is the rule the Artifacts page keeps: what is listed there is what this
 * server hosts, so Download has something to hand over and Delete has something
 * to remove.
