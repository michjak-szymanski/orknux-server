/**
 * Everything a workspace has drawn, in one place.
 *
 * A picture was reachable from the thing that drew it and nowhere else - a run
 * for an image node's, a task for an agent's - which is fine while somebody
 * remembers which run or which task that was, and useless afterwards. They
 * accumulate, they take up disk, and the only way to find one was to go through
 * runs opening steps. So they are listed here, newest first, with the two
 * things somebody wants from a file they are looking at: a copy of it, and the
 * ability to be rid of it.
 *
 * Two tables, one list. They hold the same seven columns and differ only in
 * what they hang off, so what reaches this page is one kind of thing with two
 * origins rather than two lists somebody has to check in turn.
 *
 * Only what this installation hosts. Both tables carry a `location` in the
 * [AttachmentStore] and are served from this server's own address, which is
 * what makes Download and Delete mean anything here: the bytes are ours to
 * hand over and ours to remove. A file living somewhere else - one uploaded to
 * Slack, a picture behind a link a plugin produced - is that service's, and
 * listing it would offer a Delete this server cannot perform and a copy it
 * does not have. So a third source belongs here only if its bytes are in the
 * store; anything else is a link, and a link belongs where it was posted.
