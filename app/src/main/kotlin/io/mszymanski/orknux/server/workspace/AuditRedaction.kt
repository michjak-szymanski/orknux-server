/**
 * Takes the credentials out of an audit line before it is stored.
 *
 * The audit log keeps what an agent ran, verbatim, and a perfectly ordinary
 * command carries a live credential in it: `git push
 * https://alice:s3cr3t@github.com/acme/repo.git`, `curl -u alice:s3cr3t`,
 * `export GITHUB_TOKEN=…`. Stored as typed, that password is then readable by
 * everyone who can open the admin audit page, everyone who can reach the
 * database, and everyone who has ever taken a backup of it. A secret that has
 * been in a backup has to be treated as disclosed, so this is not a display
 * problem and cannot be fixed on the way out — it is fixed here, before
 * [WorkspaceAuditRecorder] saves the row, so the plaintext never reaches the
 * table at all.
 *
 * **What replaces it.** The fixed marker [MARKER], never nothing. An audit entry
 * that silently differs from what actually ran is its own kind of lie; `***`
 * says a value was here and was removed, which is what somebody reading the log
 * needs to know.
 *
 * **What is caught**, at the time of writing:
 *
 *  - a password in a URL's userinfo — `scheme://user:secret@host` — and a bare
 *    userinfo of twenty characters or more, which is what a token pasted in
 *    place of a username looks like;
 *  - `-u user:secret` and `--user user:secret`, curl's spelling;
 *  - a credential header's value: `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`,
 *    `Authentication`, `X-Api-Key`, `X-Auth-Token`, `X-Access-Token`,
 *    `X-Amz-Security-Token`, `Private-Token`, `Api-Key`, `Auth-Token`, `Cookie`
 *    and `Set-Cookie`, wherever one appears;
 *  - `Bearer …` and `Basic …` anywhere, header or not, when what follows is
 *    eight characters or more and at least one of them is not a lowercase
 *    letter — a digit, a capital, or one of `._~+/=-`. Every base64 or JWT
 *    value has one; `Basic authentication redesign` is a workflow title and
 *    keeps its words;
 *  - `name=value` and `--name value`, quoted or bare, where the name reads like
 *    a credential — it contains `pass`, `pwd`, `secret`, `token`, `key`,
 *    `credential` or `auth` and does not end in something that names a file, a
 *    path, an id, a name, a url, a host, a port, a user or a format. That one
 *    rule covers `--password=`, `--token=`, `PGPASSWORD=`,
 *    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`, `-Dspring.datasource.password=` and
 *    `--token abc` alike, and leaves `--password-file=/etc/foo` alone, because
 *    the path to a secret is not the secret;
 *  - `-psecret` written against the flag, the way `mysql` takes it, and `-p`,
 *    `-P` or `-a` with a space after them on a line that also mentions
 *    `sshpass`, `mysql`, `redis-cli`, `smbclient` or a `login`;
 *  - things shaped like a known token wherever they stand, with no flag in
 *    front of them at all: GitHub `ghp_`/`gho_`/`ghu_`/`ghs_`/`ghr_` and
 *    `github_pat_`, Slack `xox…`, OpenAI and Anthropic `sk-`, GitLab `glpat-`,
 *    AWS `AKIA`/`ASIA` ids, Google `AIza`, and a JWT;
 *  - a PEM private key block.
 *
 * **What is not caught, and this list is the honest half.** This is a list of
 * patterns and a list of patterns is never complete. It catches the credentials
 * that arrive with a name on them; it cannot catch:
 *
 *  - **a secret as a bare positional argument** — `./deploy.sh s3cr3t`,
 *    `vault write token s3cr3t`. Nothing in the text says which word is the
 *    password, and only the well-known token shapes above are recognisable on
 *    sight;
 *  - **a secret in a heredoc, or in a file the command reads.** `curl -K
 *    creds.txt`, `psql -f seed.sql`, `ssh host <<EOF … EOF` — the credential is
 *    not in the command line, so there is nothing here to find;
 *  - **a secret that has been encoded** — a base64 blob, a hex string, a
 *    `$(pass show …)` substitution. Encoded text has no shape this can tell
 *    apart from any other argument;
 *  - **an unusual flag spelling.** `--pw`, `-k`, `--cred`, a program whose
 *    password flag is `--identity` or `--seed`: none of those read as a
 *    credential by name, and the value goes in as typed;
 *  - **a value of nothing but lowercase letters**, in the two places that is
 *    what tells a credential from a word: `-psecret` written against the
 *    flag (`-pS3cr3t` is caught), and `Bearer` or `Basic` followed by one
 *    (`Bearer abcdefgh` is not caught, and neither is a header-less
 *    `Basic dXNlcg` — though inside an `Authorization:` header both are,
 *    because the header names itself). `tar -pxzf`, `find -printf` and
 *    `Basic authentication` are all real, and mangling them would cost more
 *    than it saves;
 *  - **anything past the length an audit message is cut to.** A long command is
 *    trimmed to fit the column, and a credential in the part that was cut was
 *    never at risk — but a credential straddling the cut leaves its first few
 *    characters behind unless the caller redacts before it trims, which is why
 *    `ShellTools` does;
 *  - **the output of a command.** Only the command line is audited today, but a
 *    caller that ever put output into a message would be handing this text a
 *    secret in no shape any of these rules would find.
 *
 * An administrator who believes this is airtight is worse off than one who
 * knows its edges: the first will let an agent run `./deploy.sh $PASSWORD` and
 * assume the log is safe to hand around.
 *
 * **It over-redacts on purpose.** `MONKEY=1` becomes `MONKEY=***` because the
 * name contains `key`, and `--ssh-key id_rsa` loses the filename. An
 * over-redacted audit line is still a usable audit line; an under-redacted one
 * is a leak that has already happened by the time anybody notices.
 *
 * **Rows written before this are untouched.** This changes what is written from
 * now on. Anything already in `workspace_audit` still holds whatever it held,
 * because quietly rewriting an audit table is a worse thing to do than leaving
 * a known problem where it can be seen — what to do about what is already
 * stored is a decision for whoever runs the installation, and a credential that
 * has been sitting in there should be treated as disclosed and rotated whatever
 * they decide.
 *
 * Applying this twice gives the same answer as applying it once, so a caller
 * that redacts a command before it builds a message does no harm.
