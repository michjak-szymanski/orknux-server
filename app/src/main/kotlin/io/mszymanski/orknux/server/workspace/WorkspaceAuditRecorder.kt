/**
 * Writes the audit trail. The user id is the LDAP uid of the authenticated
 * caller, so every entry is attributable.
 *
 * **Every message passes through [AuditRedaction] on the way in.** One of the
 * things this log carries is the shell commands agents run, and a command line
 * is where a live credential most often ends up in the clear — a token in a git
 * remote, a password after `curl -u`. Redacting here rather than at each caller
 * is the point: this is the only place rows are written, so a caller added
 * later cannot forget, and redacting here rather than when the log is read
 * means the secret is never on disk or in a backup in the first place. Read the
 * [AuditRedaction] documentation for what that does and does not find; it is a
 * list of patterns, not a guarantee.
 *
 * Rows written before this existed are left exactly as they are.
