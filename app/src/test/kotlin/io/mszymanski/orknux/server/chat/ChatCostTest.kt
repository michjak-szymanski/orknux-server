/**
 * What an answer cost, on the way to the screen.
 *
 * The counting was never the missing part - `ModelChatClient` has recorded both
 * counts on every call since there was a chat, and `model_usage_day` has been
 * adding them up. What was missing was the last few feet: nothing carried them
 * out of the call, so a chat could say how long an answer took and nothing about
 * what it came to.
 *
 * So these are about carriage rather than arithmetic. A stub provider reports
 * counts the way OpenAI does, and each test follows one of them somewhere:
 * onto the answer, added up across an agent's rounds, costed at the model's
 * prices, and refused where there are none.
