/**
 * A person picking up a conversation an agent had.
 *
 * A session is written by agents going to work; nothing in it was ever said by
 * hand. This is the one way somebody joins one, and the round trip is the whole
 * feature: the chat opens holding what was already said, what is typed into it
 * is written back, and the next run to read that session hears the person as
 * plainly as it hears the agent that spoke before them.
 *
 * The binding is a pointer set when the chat is opened, not a key. A key is
 * something two callers can independently arrive at, which is what makes a
 * session shared; a key invented for a chat would name a conversation nothing
 * else could ever reach, so a chat opened any other way still has no session at
 * all.
