/**
 * That the lookups a chat draws while they are happening say the same thing as
 * the lookups it reads back afterwards.
 *
 * Issue #291, and the second half of #289. That one took the credentials out of
 * what is *stored*: `LlmSessionRecorder` strips a tool call's arguments before
 * the row is saved, so a `git push https://alice:s3cr3t@host/repo.git` reads
 * `alice:***@host` on the page a reload draws. The same fact leaves the round by
 * a second road - `RoundWatch`, which this endpoint forwards straight to the
 * browser - and that one carried the password in full. One command, on one
 * screen, reading two different ways depending on whether you were watching when
 * it ran.
 *
 * **Everything here is asserted on the frames**, decoded out of the response the
 * way the browser's own parser would. That is the point: the previous change
 * passed every test it had, because every one of them looked at the row. A
 * function returning the right string is not the claim - what arrives on the
 * wire is.
 *
 * The two strengths are held apart, and the second half is the half that would
 * go unnoticed if it broke. Arguments are a command line and take the full rule
 * set. Results are arbitrary output - a build log, a `--help` - and take only
 * what is a credential on sight, because a live view that showed
 * `cannot find symbol ***` while the stored copy read correctly would be this
 * bug with the sides swapped. And the last test is the guard on all of it: the
 * model goes on being handed the real command, or the fix has broken the work it
 * was protecting.
