/**
 * What a reasoning model thought, read out of each shape this product speaks.
 *
 * There are three ways it arrives and the client used to read none of them:
 *
 *  - **`reasoning_content` in the OpenAI shape.** DeepSeek's field, copied by
 *    vLLM, SGLang and llama.cpp's server; `reasoning` is the same field under
 *    the other spelling some gateways use. Not in OpenAI's own specification,
 *    and OpenAI's own endpoint sends no reasoning text at all - only a token
 *    count - so a model behind it thinks in silence and that is the provider's
 *    decision rather than something this can recover.
 *  - **A `thinking` content block in Anthropic's shape**, beside the text ones.
 *  - **A leading `<think>` block inside `content`**, which is what a local
 *    server passing a chat template through hands back for DeepSeek-R1 and
 *    Qwen3. This was the visible half of the bug: the tags were on screen, in
 *    the copy control and read out by the speech model, because the thinking
 *    was arriving as part of the answer.
 *
 * The one assertion every test here makes is the same one: **the answer does
 * not contain the thinking**. Everything downstream is correct because of that
 * and not because three separate places remember to strip it - the copy
 * control, the speech model and the next turn's prompt all read the answer.
