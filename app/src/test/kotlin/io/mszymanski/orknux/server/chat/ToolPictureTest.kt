/**
 * A picture a tool made, on its way to something that can see it.
 *
 * The answer to a tool call is a `tool` message and its content is a string, so
 * base64 in a tool's answer is thousands of characters a model can read and
 * cannot look at. What closes that gap is two named fields: a tool says it made
 * a picture, the loop takes the bytes out and hangs them on a turn of their
 * own, and what the model reads as the tool's answer keeps a sentence where
 * four hundred kilobytes would have been.
 *
 * The contract is the field names, and it is held by two packages that ship
 * separately - the pdf plugin writes `picture`, this reads it. So the shape in
 * the first test is `pdf_preview`'s real answer rather than a sketch of one: if
 * either side renames the field, this is what says so.
