/**
 * That a transcript never holds the password, and still holds the build log.
 *
 * The same claim `WorkspaceAuditRecorderTest` makes about the audit table, and
 * it is made the same way: everything here is asserted on the row read back out
 * of the repository, never on what `save` handed over. A redaction done on the
 * way out to a page would pass a test that looked at the page and leave the
 * plaintext on disk, in every backup and in front of anybody who runs a
 * `SELECT` - and a secret that has been in a backup has to be treated as
 * disclosed, so where it happens is the whole of the fix.
 *
 * Two doors, two strengths, and the second half of this class is the half that
 * would go unnoticed if it broke. Arguments take the full rule set; results
 * take only what is a credential on sight, because a result is handed back to
 * the model as the answer to its own lookup and a build log turned into
 * asterisks is a model that cannot do the work.
