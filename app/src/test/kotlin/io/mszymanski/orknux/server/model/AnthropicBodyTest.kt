/**
 * What `anthropicBody` actually puts on the wire.
 *
 * Every test here asserts the bytes of the request rather than that the call
 * succeeded, because succeeding was never what was in doubt. The stub records
 * the request body and the assertions are about what is in it.
 *
 * **Pictures**, which is where this began. `openAiBody` carried a turn's images
 * as `image_url` parts and `anthropicBody` had no branch for them at all, so a
 * turn with a picture reached an Anthropic provider as words alone. Nothing
 * failed and nothing was logged - the model simply answered, plausibly and at
 * length, about something it had never been shown. An agent whose entire
 * purpose was reading a screenshot appeared to work.
 *
 * **Alternation**, which fails the opposite way. Anthropic rejects two messages
 * of one role in a row, so a run of them is a 400 and no answer at all. The
 * shapes that produce one are ordinary - an agent that said something on its
 * way to a lookup and then answered, a round that threaded back three tool
 * results - and they are joined here rather than anywhere upstream, for the
 * reasons `anthropicBody` gives.
