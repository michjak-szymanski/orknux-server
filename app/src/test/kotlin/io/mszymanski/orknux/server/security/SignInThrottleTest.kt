/**
 * The rule itself, without a server around it.
 *
 * What these hold to is the shape of the promise rather than the numbers: a
 * mistyped password costs nothing, a list of guesses costs more each time, and
 * every wait ends. The last of those is the one worth guarding - a throttle that
 * could be made permanent by somebody else's knocking is a way of taking a
 * colleague off the system, which is a worse hole than the one it closes.
 *
 * The waits here are milliseconds rather than the configured seconds, so that
 * "it ends" is something a test can sit through.
