/**
 * When a task is handed to a worker, and what that worker can read when it is.
 *
 * A task is written inside a transaction and worked on outside one: everything
 * that reaches [TaskEngine] does so from a `@Transactional` method of
 * [TaskService], and the worker that answers reads the task by its id on a
 * thread and a connection of its own. Handed over a moment too early it reads
 * the row that is not there yet, [TaskLoop.advance] returns [TaskTurn.Over], and
 * the task sits at QUEUED until the process restarts - which is what every task
 * started through the API did on an installation running the inline engine.
 *
 * **These are not races.** The transaction is held open by the test until the
 * worker has read, or until [WHILE_WRITING] says it never will - so the read a
 * too-early hand-over performs happens while the row is provably uncommitted,
 * rather than whenever the machine got round to it. The cost of that is the two
 * transactional tests below each waiting [WHILE_WRITING] out once the hand-over
 * is correctly deferred, which is the price of the failure being certain rather
 * than likely.
 *
 * [TaskLoop] is the one thing stood in for. It is where a worker reads the task,
 * so it is where what the worker could see is written down; everything above it
 * - the service, its transaction, the engine and its thread pool - is what is
 * deployed.
