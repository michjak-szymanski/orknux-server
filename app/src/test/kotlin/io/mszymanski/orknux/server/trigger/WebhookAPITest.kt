 * What is asserted is mostly what a caller is *not* told. A webhook path is a
 * name somebody chose, so a caller who can tell "there is nothing here" apart
 * from "there is something here and you sent it the wrong thing" can walk a list
 * of guesses and learn which webhooks this installation has armed. Every answer
 * that is not a start has to be the same answer.
 *
 * The requests are made anonymously on purpose: signing in is exactly what a
 * build server calling a webhook cannot do, and the leak is only a leak for a
 * caller who has not.
