/**
 * What publishing is for.

 * It used to be a word on a screen: a trigger fired every workflow with a node
 * instancing it, and the runner read the rows as they stood - so an event
 * arriving while somebody was halfway through drawing ran the half-drawn
 * graph, whatever the badge said. These pin the two halves of the fix: an
 * event runs the copy taken at publication, and a person pressing Run gets
 * what is on their screen.
