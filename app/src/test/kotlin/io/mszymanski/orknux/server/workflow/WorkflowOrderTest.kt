/**
 * The order a page of workflows comes back in, decided by the query.
 *
 * The point of every test here is that the order is applied *before* the page
 * is cut, not after. That is the whole difference between sorting a list and
 * sorting the rows that happen to be on screen, and it is invisible in a test
 * that asks for one page big enough to hold everything - so each of these asks
 * for a page of two out of four and says which two.
