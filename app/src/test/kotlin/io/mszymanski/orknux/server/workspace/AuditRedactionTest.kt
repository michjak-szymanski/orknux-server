/**
 * The credentials an audit line is stripped of, and the words it keeps.
 *
 * Real command lines rather than invented ones, because the failure this guards
 * against is a shape nobody thought of: a password reaches the table the moment
 * a command spells its flag differently from the pattern, and nothing on the
 * audit page says it happened. The table below is the list of spellings that
 * have been thought of, and it is the whole of the claim being made.
 *
 * The negative half matters as much. An audit log where `git commit -m "fix the
 * password reset page"` comes back as asterisks is a log people stop reading,
 * and a redactor people stop reading gets turned off — so the words `password`
 * and `key` in prose, and the paths that carry them, have to survive intact.
