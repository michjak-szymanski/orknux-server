/**
 * That the redaction happens on the way in, and not on the way out.
 *
 * This is the assertion the whole fix rests on: not that the audit page hides a
 * password, but that the row in `workspace_audit` never held one. A read-time
 * filter would pass a test that looked at what the page shows and leave the
 * plaintext on disk, in every backup, and in front of anyone who runs a `SELECT`
 * — so what is asserted here is the stored message, read back out of the
 * repository, on every one of the recorder's three ways in.
