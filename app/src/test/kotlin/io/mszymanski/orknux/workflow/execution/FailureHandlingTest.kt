/**
 * What a run does when a step cannot do its work.
 *
 * Two answers, and both of them are the node's: attempt it again, for a failure
 * that might come out differently, and leave by a different edge, for one that
 * will not. A node given neither behaves exactly as it always has, which is the
 * property most of these are really about.
 *
 * The inline engine, so a run has finished by the time `start` returns and the
 * assertions can be about what it did.
