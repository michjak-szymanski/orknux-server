 * alone unless the administrator asks for a default to be handed to them too.
 *
 * The connector has no workspace table, so a backfill asks orknux-server which workspaces
 * exist. A new workspace is provisioned when the server says it was created — see
 * `provisionWorkspaceConnections` on [WorkspaceConnectionAPI].
