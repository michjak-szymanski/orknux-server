 *
 * Here rather than in the server for the reason [OutgoingMessages] is: this is
 * where the token lives, and the token is decrypted in this module and nowhere
 * else. The server asks a question and is told an answer.
 *
 * **Two questions, one vocabulary.** [check] is one lookup about one name, and
 * [suggest] is a list to pick from; they answer with the same
 * [SlackTargetOutcome] and the same sentences, because they fail in the same
 * ways and a form draws them a few pixels apart. Where they differ is what they
 * cost: [check] reads one page and reports what it could not settle, while
 * [suggest] pages, caches per connection, and is bounded on both.
 *
 * **Neither of them needs to be told which kind.** [SlackTargetKind] is a
 * narrowing and not a requirement, because it describes Slack's lookups rather
 * than Slack's addressing - one `chat.postMessage` sends to either. A question
 * asked without one searches both halves and merges them, and the merge has
 * three rules worth stating:
 *
 *  - **A sigil or an id shape settles it and costs nothing.** `#support` is a
 *    channel, `@alice`, an address and a `U…` id are people, and a `C…` id is a
 *    channel. Only a bare name that could be either is asked about twice.
 *  - **Channels come before people at equal rank.** Something has to break the
 *    tie and this is the side to break it towards: a channel name is unique in
 *    a Slack and a display name is not, so the row a person sees first is the
 *    one that can only mean one thing.
 *  - **Half an answer never becomes a verdict.** Found in one half is
 *    [SlackTargetOutcome.FOUND]. Absent from both, both read whole, is
 *    [SlackTargetOutcome.NOT_FOUND]. Absent from the half that answered while
 *    the other was refused is [SlackTargetOutcome.UNCHECKED] and the refusal's
 *    own sentence, because the name may well be in the half nobody read.
 *
 * **The scope is the whole design.** `users.list` and `users.info` need
 * `users:read`, and the channel lookups need `channels:read` and `groups:read`.
 * A bot token that posts perfectly well carries none of them, because nothing
 * about *sending* requires them. So a token that cannot introspect has to
 * produce a different answer from a name that is wrong, in words that say the
 * connection is fine and the typing has not been judged. That is
 * [SlackTargetOutcome.UNCHECKED], and suggesting degrades to it rather than to
 * a failure: an empty picker with no reason under it reads as a broken
 * connection, which is the one impression this must not leave.
 *
 * A merged answer names the scopes that are actually missing and only those. A
 * token carrying `channels:read` and not `users:read` is the case this merge was
 * built for - it used to be shown nothing at all, because nothing could tell it
 * which half to ask - and what it is shown now is every channel, and one line
 * saying that the members need `users:read`.
 *
 * **What a merged question costs, and why nothing had to change for it.** A
 * merged miss reads two lists where a narrowed one reads one, and that is one
 * request against each of two budgets rather than two against one: Slack meters
 * per method, so `conversations.list` and `users.list` do not share a bucket and
 * a merged read spends the same share of each as a narrowed read of that half
 * did. [suggest] pays it once and not per keystroke, because the two entries it
 * fills are the two the cache already keeps and the next question - merged or
 * not - is a lookup in a map. [check] is uncached by design and pays for both
 * halves each time, which is why a sigil, an address or an id is taken as the
 * answer it is rather than confirmed against the other half.
 *
 * The one bound worth restating is [SlackListingCache]'s: thirty-two lists, two
 * per connection, so sixteen Slacks being typed against at once. A merged
 * question keeps both of one connection's entries warm rather than one, which is
 * what that cap was always counted in.
 *
 * **Neither of them gates anything.** The field they describe is free text and
 * stays free text. `createAction` and `updateAction` do not call either.
 *
 * **No token reaches a message or a log.** The credential is passed to the SDK
 * and is not interpolated into anything that comes back out; a failure is logged
 * by connection id.
