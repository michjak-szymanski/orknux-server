/**
 * A model call somebody may hang up on while it is still running.
 *
 * **Why a handle rather than an interrupt.** A streaming call spends nearly all
 * of its life blocked on a socket read, and `Thread.interrupt` does not end one
 * of those: the SDK reads through an ordinary socket stream, which is not an
 * interruptible channel, so the flag is set and the thread goes on waiting for a
 * model that is still writing. What does end it is closing the thing being read,
 * and only the client that opened it knows what that is - a `StreamResponse` for
 * the SDK path and a response body for the hand-built one. So the client hands
 * over the closing rather than the caller guessing at it.
 *
 * **It is used from another thread, always.** The thread making the call is
 * inside the read; the thread deciding to give up is whoever noticed that nobody
 * is listening any more. Every field here is therefore behind one lock, and
 * [holding] deliberately closes straight away when it arrives after [hangUp] -
 * a call that opened a stream a moment too late must not be left running for
 * the same reason the ordinary one must not.
 *
 * Hanging up is not an answer and is not reported as one. What the caller gets
 * back is whatever the torn read produced, which is a failure; nobody is waiting
 * for it, which is the whole reason it was hung up on.
