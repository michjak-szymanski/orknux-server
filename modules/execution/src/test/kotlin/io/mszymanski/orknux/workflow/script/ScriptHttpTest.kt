/**
 * A function making an HTTP request, which it could not do at all before.
 *
 * `NETWORK_REQUEST` was a plugin's alone, withheld from functions on the
 * reasoning that its bound is the grant and a function has nobody to give one.
 * That was overruled on 2026-09-06: a function that cannot call an HTTP service
 * cannot do most of what people write functions for, and the alternatives - an
 * action, an MCP server - are heavier things to build and keep for one request.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the shape, because the shape is what makes it safe
 * to offer and pleasant to use:
 *
 *   as data       the URL goes over as JSON and the answer comes back as JSON.
 *                 The script never holds a socket, so there is nothing to keep
 *                 open, to listen on, or to reflect from
 *   the proxy     the request is the *server's* to make, so an installation's
 *                 proxy rules govern it - the script cannot see them and cannot
 *                 argue with them
 *   JSON both ways an object body is sent as JSON and says so; a JSON reply
 *                 arrives parsed, beside the text it was parsed from
 *   refusal       a failure is a value with an error on it, so a condition can
 *                 still decide rather than become undecidable
